== Introduction ==

     PHP-Reader provides a very simple and easily usable toolset to read media files and their information headers in an object-oriented manner so that they can be easily output or stepped through using iterators. It requires PHP5.

== Use ==

PHP-Reader is a modular system, you may include files as needed, for example, in order to be able to parse ASF information, simply include the ASF.php file into your code using [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php include_once()] or [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php require_once()].

== Examples ==

The power and simplicity of PHP-Reader appear very quickly when it interacts with a media file:
{{{
<?php
require_once("ID3v1.php");
$id3 = new ID3v1("file.mp3");
echo "Title: " . $id3->title;
?>
}}}
PHP-Reader was built to enable access to as many different media files as possible through as easy an interface as possible for that media, while also maintaining power and flexibility. This can be seen easily through the way in which you can easily step through every tag present in your file.
{{{
<?php
require_once("ID3v2.php");
$id3 = new ID3v2("file.mp3");
foreach ($id3->getFramesByIdentifier("T*") as $frame)
  echo $frame->identifier . ": " . $frame->text[0] . "<br />\n";
?>
}}}
PHP-Reader goes beyond what it's name implies. It is not only able to read Tags, but can also write them. with the ID3v1 writing information into an MP3 file through PHP is as easy as ever, all you need to do is load the file, tell it what information you want where, and then tell it to write that information.
{{{
<?php
require_once("ID3v1.php");
$id3 = new ID3v1("file.mp3");
$id3->title = "{$id3->title} by me!";
$id3->album = "My album";
$id3->write();
?>
}}}
